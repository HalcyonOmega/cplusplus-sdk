# Community Support Channels

---

## Overview

Having a clear support channel helps users get help quickly and encourages community engagement. For now, all support and community interaction for this SDK happens on GitHub.

## Where to Get Help

- **GitHub Issues:**
  - Use for bug reports, feature requests, and general questions.
  - Search existing issues before opening a new one—your question might already be answered!
  - Provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, environment, code snippets, etc.).

- **GitHub Discussions (if enabled):**
  - Use for open-ended questions, ideas, or community chat.
  - Great for sharing tips, asking for advice, or discussing future plans.

## How to Ask for Help

1. Check the README and documentation for answers.
2. Search existing issues and discussions.
3. Open a new issue if you can't find what you need.
   - Use the appropriate template (bug, feature, question) if available.
   - Be clear and respectful—everyone's here to help!

## Future Channels

- As the project grows, additional support channels (e.g., Discord, Matrix, mailing list) may be added based on community needs.
- Updates will be announced in the README and project site.

**TL;DR:**
- Use GitHub Issues (and Discussions, if enabled) for all support
- Search before posting, be clear, and follow templates
- More channels may be added as the community grows
