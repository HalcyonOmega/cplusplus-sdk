# API Design Principles

-   **Simplicity & Ease of Use:** 
    -   MCP Design Principle: Servers should be easy to build, implying hosts (and thus SDKs facilitating host development) handle complexity (SDK_FullReference 1.3).
-   **Consistency:** (Refer to `naming-conventions`)
    -   Adherence to **JSON-RPC 2.0** specification for all messages (SDK_FullReference 1.2).
-   **Flexibility & Extensibility:** 
    -   Support for **Progressive Feature Adoption** through capability negotiation (SDK_FullReference 1.3, 2.3).
-   **Performance:** 
-   **Safety & Robustness:**
