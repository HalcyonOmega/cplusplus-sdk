# Bug Tracking & Issue Management

---

## Overview

Effective bug tracking and issue management helps keep the project healthy, organized, and welcoming to contributors. For open source projects, transparency and good communication are key.

## Where to Track Issues

- **GitHub Issues:**
  - Use GitHub Issues for all bug reports, feature requests, and questions.
  - Keep issues public so others can search, comment, and contribute.

## Best Practices

- **Use Issue Templates:**
  - Create templates for bug reports, feature requests, and questions to help users provide the right info up front.
  - Example fields: steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, environment, screenshots/logs.

- **Label Issues:**
  - Use labels to categorize issues (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`, `help wanted`, `good first issue`).
  - This helps with triage and makes it easier for new contributors to find ways to help.

- **Triage Regularly:**
  - Review new issues, ask for clarification if needed, and label appropriately.
  - Close duplicates and stale issues politely.

- **Be Responsive and Respectful:**
  - Thank users for their reports and suggestions.
  - Communicate progress and decisions clearly.
  - If you can't fix something right away, let people know.

- **Track Known Issues:**
  - Keep a list of known issues (in the README or a dedicated doc) if there are major limitations or workarounds.

- **Link Issues and PRs:**
  - Reference issues in pull requests and commits (e.g., `Fixes #42`).
  - Close issues automatically when PRs are merged.

- **Encourage Contributions:**
  - Use `help wanted` and `good first issue` labels to highlight tasks for new contributors.
  - Document the process for reporting bugs and submitting fixes in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## For Solo Maintainers

- Even if you're the only maintainer, use issues to track your own TODOs and bugsâ€”it's good practice and helps if others join later.
- Be honest about project status and response times.
