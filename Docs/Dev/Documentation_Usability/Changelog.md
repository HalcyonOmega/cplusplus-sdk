# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) principles and uses epoch semantic versioning.

## How to Use This Changelog

- Add a new section for each release, with the version and date.
- Use the following sections as needed:
  - **Added** for new features
  - **Changed** for updates to existing functionality
  - **Fixed** for bug fixes
  - **Removed** for deprecated features that are removed
- Keep entries short, clear, and user-focused.
- Unreleased changes can go under an `Unreleased` section at the top.
