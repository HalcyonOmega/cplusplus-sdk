# Phase 2: Protocol Core Implementation

1. **JSON-RPC 2.0 Engine**
   - Implement robust JSON-RPC 2.0 message parsing, validation, and dispatch.
   - Support requests, responses, notifications, and batch messages.
   - Ensure UTF-8 encoding and newline-delimited messages for stdio.

2. **Transport Abstractions**
   - Implement stdio transport (process pipes).
   - Implement HTTP/Streamable HTTP transport (with SSE support).
   - Design extensible transport interfaces for future protocols.

3. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Implement initialization handshake (`initialize`, `initialized`).
   - Support version and capability negotiation.
   - Handle clean shutdown and timeouts.
