# Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundations

1. **Review and finalize project structure**
   - Ensure clear separation between public API, internal logic, and protocol schemas.
   - Organize directories for `Core`, `Communication`, `Schemas`, `Features`, and `Utilities`.

2. **Establish build system**
   - Use CMake for cross-platform builds.
   - Set up CI for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
   - Integrate code formatting and linting (clang-format, clang-tidy).

3. **Document developer workflow**
   - Provide a quickstart in the README.
   - Document how to build, test, and extend the SDK.
