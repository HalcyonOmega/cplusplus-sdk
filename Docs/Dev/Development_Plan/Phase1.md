# Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundations

## 1. Review and finalize project structure

- [ ] Audit current directory and file organization for clarity and modularity
    - [ ] Ensure clear separation between public API, internal logic, and protocol schemas
    - [ ] Organize directories for `Core`, `Communication`, `Schemas`, `Features`, and `Utilities`
    - [ ] Remove or archive deprecated/unused files and folders
    - [ ] Validate naming conventions for consistency (folders, files, classes, etc.)
    - [ ] Ensure test and example code are in dedicated directories
    - [ ] Document the finalized structure in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` or similar

## 2. Establish build system

- [ ] Ensure the build system leverages the existing `CMakeLists.txt` files in the root and `Source/` directories
    - [ ] Confirm that CMake is configured to automatically find and include all source and header files recursively (already implemented in `Source/CMakeLists.txt` using `file(GLOB_RECURSE ...)`)
    - [ ] No manual file listing should be required for new source/header files
    - [ ] Ensure modular subdirectory CMake files are used as needed for maintainability
    - [ ] Define targets for static/shared libraries and executables
    - [ ] Integrate third-party dependencies (as submodules or via CMake FetchContent)
    - [ ] Configure out-of-source builds and build types (Debug/Release)
    - [ ] Validate build process on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- [ ] Set up Continuous Integration (CI)
    - [ ] Configure CI pipelines for all supported platforms (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines)
    - [ ] Automate build, test, and lint steps in CI
    - [ ] Add build status badges to the README
- [ ] Integrate code formatting and linting
    - [ ] Note: `.clangd`, `.clang-tidy`, and `.clang-format` configuration files are already present; no changes needed unless requirements change
    - [ ] Add formatting/linting checks to CI
    - [ ] Provide scripts or instructions for local formatting/linting

## 3. Document developer workflow

- [ ] Provide a quickstart guide in the README
    - [ ] Describe prerequisites (compilers, CMake, dependencies)
    - [ ] Step-by-step build and test instructions
    - [ ] Example usage or minimal working example
- [ ] Document how to build, test, and extend the SDK
    - [ ] Explain directory structure and where to add new features
    - [ ] Describe how to run and write tests
    - [ ] Document code style and contribution guidelines
    - [ ] Add instructions for submitting issues and pull requests
- [ ] Ensure all documentation is accessible and up-to-date
    - [ ] Link to relevant docs from the README
    - [ ] Periodically review and update documentation as the project evolves
