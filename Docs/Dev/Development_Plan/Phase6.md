# Phase 6: Testing & Quality

## 1. Unit and Integration Tests
- [ ] Cover all protocol features and edge cases
    - [ ] Write unit tests for each protocol message type and handler
    - [ ] Write integration tests for end-to-end workflows (client-server, multi-transport)
    - [ ] Test all supported transports (stdio, HTTP, SSE, etc.)
    - [ ] Test error conditions, invalid inputs, and edge cases
    - [ ] Track and improve test coverage using tools like `gcov`, `lcov`, or `Codecov`
    - [ ] Add regression tests for all reported bugs

## 2. Mock Servers/Clients
- [ ] Provide mock implementations for testing and development
    - [ ] Implement mock server for protocol compliance and client-side testing
    - [ ] Implement mock client for server-side testing
    - [ ] Support configurable responses and error injection in mocks
    - [ ] Document usage of mocks in test suites and for local development
    - [ ] Add tests that use mocks to simulate real-world scenarios

## 3. Continuous Integration
- [ ] Run tests and static analysis on all supported platforms
    - [ ] Set up CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for Linux, Windows, and macOS
    - [ ] Run all unit and integration tests automatically on every push and pull request
    - [ ] Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., ClangTidy, cppcheck) in CI
    - [ ] Enforce code formatting and linting in CI
    - [ ] Collect and report code coverage metrics in CI
    - [ ] Document CI setup and quality gates for contributors
