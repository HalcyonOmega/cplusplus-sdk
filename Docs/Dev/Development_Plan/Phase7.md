# Phase 7: Advanced Features (Post-MVP)

## 1. OAuth 2.1 Authorization (for HTTP)
- [ ] Implement optional OAuth 2.1 flows for secure server access
    - [ ] Integrate OAuth 2.1 authorization code and client credentials flows
    - [ ] Support token acquisition, refresh, and revocation endpoints
    - [ ] Securely store and manage access/refresh tokens
    - [ ] Add configuration options for OAuth endpoints and credentials
    - [ ] Document OAuth integration and security considerations
    - [ ] Add tests for OAuth flows, error handling, and edge cases

## 2. Session Management
- [ ] Support session IDs, resumability, and reconnection logic
    - [ ] Implement session ID generation and validation (globally unique, secure)
    - [ ] Support session resumption after disconnects (e.g., reconnect with session ID)
    - [ ] Handle session expiration, invalidation, and cleanup
    - [ ] Add reconnection logic for interrupted transports (HTTP, SSE, etc.)
    - [ ] Document session management, reconnection, and failure scenarios
    - [ ] Add tests for session lifecycle, reconnection, and edge cases

## 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile and optimize serialization, transport, and memory usage
    - [ ] Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in serialization/deserialization
    - [ ] Optimize transport layer for throughput and latency (e.g., batching, async I/O)
    - [ ] Minimize memory allocations and improve cache locality
    - [ ] Add benchmarks for critical code paths (serialization, transport, etc.)
    - [ ] Document performance tuning options and best practices
    - [ ] Add regression tests to catch performance regressions
