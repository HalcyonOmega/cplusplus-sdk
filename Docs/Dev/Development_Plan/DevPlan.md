# SDK Development Plan

## Development Prompt

---
**Instructions:**
- Use nested GitHub-style checklists for clarity and developer usability.
- Reference protocol, schema, and SDK documentation as needed for accuracy.
- Prioritize developer experience, robust error handling, extensibility, and comprehensive documentation throughout.
- Do not include any timelines or estimates for phases or tasks.
- As you complete tasks, update the corresponding phase tracker, marking off completed items.
- Provide short, critical feedback summaries for any issues, blockers, or important observations.
- Stay organized and follow user guidance explicitly.
- If you encounter any ambiguity or missing information, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- Use clear, concise questions for any required user input.
- Incorporate feedback and iterate on checklists as needed.
