# Phase 5: Developer Experience

## 1. Intuitive API Design
- [ ] Provide high-level, ergonomic C++ APIs for common tasks
    - [ ] Design APIs that abstract protocol complexity behind simple interfaces
    - [ ] Use modern C++ idioms (RAII, smart pointers, ranges, etc.)
    - [ ] Ensure APIs are discoverable and self-documenting (e.g., clear naming, overloads)
    - [ ] Add usage examples for each major API
    - [ ] Solicit feedback from early adopters and iterate on API ergonomics
    - [ ] Add unit tests for API surface and usability

## 2. Error Handling
- [ ] Use modern C++ error handling throughout the SDK
    - [ ] Prefer `std::expected` or similar for recoverable errors
    - [ ] Use exceptions for unrecoverable or contract violations (with clear documentation)
    - [ ] Provide clear, actionable error messages for all failure cases
    - [ ] Document error handling strategy and common error types
    - [ ] Add tests for error propagation and recovery scenarios

## 3. Extensibility
- [ ] Allow users to register custom tools, resources, and prompts
    - [ ] Design plugin-style extension points for tools, resources, and prompts
    - [ ] Document extension APIs and registration workflow
    - [ ] Support dynamic loading or linking of extensions (if feasible)
    - [ ] Add examples for writing and registering custom extensions
    - [ ] Add tests for extension registration and invocation

## 4. Comprehensive Documentation
- [ ] Document all public APIs with usage examples
    - [ ] Maintain up-to-date API reference documentation (Markdown or generated)
    - [ ] Provide guides for common integration scenarios (e.g., quickstart, advanced usage)
    - [ ] Include in-source documentation and comments for all public classes/functions
    - [ ] Add changelogs and deprecation notices as needed
    - [ ] Encourage user feedback and contributions to documentation
    - [ ] Add documentation tests or validation steps in CI
