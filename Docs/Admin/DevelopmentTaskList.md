# Docs/Dev - Remaining Tasks

## Prompt

---

**Admin work is now complete!**

- All placeholder Markdown documents in `Docs/Dev/` have been filled out or reviewed.
- All type schemas are already initialized in the `Source/` folder.
- The next step is to create a detailed development plan for implementing the SDK logic in `Docs/Admin/SDK_DevelopmentPlan.md`.
- **Key focus:** Deliver an outstanding developer experience for end users of the SDKâ€”make it intuitive, robust, and a joy to use.

Your role is to create a step-by-step development plan for building out the SDK's actual functionality, referencing the schemas and all documentation as needed. Prioritize developer experience in every decision.
