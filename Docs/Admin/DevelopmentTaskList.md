# Docs/Dev - Remaining Tasks

## Prompt

---

Hello! We are in the process of populating a series of placeholder Markdown documents within the `Docs/Dev/` directory for a C++ SDK project. The goal is to create comprehensive development documentation.

Our primary source of truth for anything related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification is the document located at `Docs/Admin/SDK_FullReference.md`. Please refer to this document for any MCP-specific details needed to inform the content of the development documents.

We have already completed an initial pass where we (you, the AI, and I, the user) filled in several files with information that could be directly and objectively derived from the `SDK_FullReference.md`. These completed files are:
*   `Docs/Dev/CoreSDK_Design_Architecture/API_Design_Principles.md`
*   `Docs/Dev/CoreSDK_Design_Architecture/Modularization_Strategy.md`
*   `Docs/Dev/CoreSDK_Design_Architecture/Error_Handling_Logging.md`
*   `Docs/Dev/Development_Implementation/Coding_Standards_Guidelines.md`
*   `Docs/Dev/Development_Implementation/Versioning_Strategy.md`
*   `Docs/Dev/Documentation_Usability/Developer_Guide.md`

Our current task is to work through the *remaining* placeholder files. These remaining files generally require more subjective input, project-specific decisions, or information that isn't explicitly detailed in the `SDK_FullReference.md` (e.g., choices about specific tools, libraries, or team processes). I will provide this guidance.

The task list of documents that still need to be completed is below.

Your role is to help me fill out these remaining documents, one by one, based on my input and decisions. I will specify which file we are working on. For general style and tone, please maintain a casual but accurate and thorough approach.

Let's begin. I will now choose the next file from the list above for us to work on. Please wait for my selection.
