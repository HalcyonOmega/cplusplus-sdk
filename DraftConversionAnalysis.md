Revised Executive Summary:

The `Reference/DraftConversion` directory represents a direct translation effort of the official TypeScript MCP SDK into C++. It successfully captures the overall structure and many functional components of the TypeScript SDK, with C++ classes, methods, and feature placeholders (e.g., for client/server logic, resources, prompts, tools) that mirror the TypeScript counterparts. However, the C++ implementation within `DraftConversion` is preliminary, relying on stubs, `// TODO:` markers for detailed logic, and C++ specific mechanisms like `Passthrough` that require further development for robust JSON handling and serialization.

Separately, the `Source/Public/Schemas/` directory contains more mature and detailed C++ schema definitions (e.g., `JSON_RPC_Schemas.h`, `InitializeSchemas.h`, `ResourceSchemas.h`) that are directly based on the MCP specification. These are distinct from the more placeholder-like schema files within `DraftConversion` (such as `Capabilities.hpp`) and should be considered the primary C++ schema source for the SDK.

To move forward, the `DraftConversion`'s structural skeleton needs to be fleshed out by implementing the TODOs, integrating the more complete schemas from the `Source/` directory, and solidifying C++ specific patterns for asynchronous operations, error handling, and JSON processing. While the structural translation provides a foundation, significant implementation work remains.

Clarifications based on Feedback:

1.  **C++ Type Safety vs. Protocol Schema Validation:** While C++ offers compile-time type safety for internal operations, runtime validation of JSON data against a schema (as done by libraries like Zod in TypeScript) is crucial for interoperability in a protocol like MCP. It ensures that data exchanged with external systems (potentially non-C++ or different SDK versions) adheres to the MCP specification, preventing errors from malformed or unexpected data during serialization/deserialization.
2.  **`Source/` Schemas as Primary:** The schemas within `Source/Public/Schemas/` are acknowledged as the more complete C++ representations of MCP data structures and should be the target for integration, superseding the more basic schema stubs in `DraftConversion`.
3.  **`Core.h` and `Passthrough` Type:** `Core.h` is understood as a common include aggregator. The `Passthrough` type is a mechanism intended to help manage JSON member ordering during serialization in derived classes, a C++ specific consideration for mapping objects to JSON.
4.  **Direct Translation Goal:** The evaluation of `DraftConversion` is now based on its success as a direct structural and functional translation from the TypeScript SDK, focusing on "feature capture" rather than implementation completeness at this stage.

Revised Estimated Compliance of `Reference/DraftConversion` (based on structural feature capture from TypeScript SDK):

*   **Estimated Feature Capture Compliance: 60-70%**
    *   This revised estimate reflects that `DraftConversion` (e.g., in `Client.hpp`, `ServerMCP.hpp`) has made a significant effort to lay out the classes, methods, and overall structure corresponding to the TypeScript SDK's client, server, and feature management logic. Most major MCP operations (initialization, resources, prompts, tools, etc.) have representative structures or method signatures. The reduction from 100% is due to observed TODOs in critical areas like capabilities merging, full serialization/deserialization logic for complex types, concrete implementation of asynchronous patterns, and schema validation, which, even in a structural translation, represent gaps in fully capturing all TypeScript SDK functionalities into a compilable and near-functional C++ stub.

Revised Major Issues/Details in `Reference/DraftConversion` (viewed as a direct translation effort):

1.  **Schema Integration Needed:**
    *   The schema definitions within `DraftConversion` (e.g., `Capabilities.hpp`) are rudimentary compared to the TypeScript Zod schemas and the more detailed C++ schemas in `Source/Public/Schemas/`. The `DraftConversion` code relies on generic `JSON` objects or placeholders where specific typed structures (integrating with `Source/` schemas) would be required.
2.  **Lack of C++ Idiomatic File Separation (.h/.cpp):**
    *   Stemming from its direct translation from TypeScript, `DraftConversion` largely contains both declarations and definitions within single header files (e.g., `Client.hpp`, `ServerMCP.hpp`). This is contrary to common C++ practice, which separates these into header (.hpp) and implementation (.cpp) files for better modularity, reduced compilation dependencies, and improved code organization. This refactoring is a necessary step.
3.  **Extensive Implementation TODOs:**
    *   Files like `Client.hpp` and `ServerMCP.hpp` contain numerous `// TODO:` comments. These mark areas where essential logic for the C++ implementation is missing, such as:
        *   Complete serialization and deserialization of complex request/response parameters and results (currently often placeholder `JSON::object()` or comments).
        *   Full implementation of capability checking and merging.
        *   Detailed protocol version negotiation and validation.
        *   Robust error handling and mapping to MCP error codes.
        *   Implementation of the actual business logic for many MCP methods beyond just calling a generic request function.
4.  **JSON Handling and Validation Strategy:**
    *   The current approach uses a generic `JSON` type (presumably from a library like nlohmann/json, which you've confirmed is available in `Source/`) and a placeholder `AjvValidator`. A consistent strategy for mapping C++ objects to/from JSON using `nlohmann/json` (as per the `Source/` schemas) and for validating external JSON data needs to be fully implemented. The `Passthrough` concept for serialization order needs to be robustly implemented or an alternative found.
5.  **Asynchronous Operations:**
    *   The use of `async<>` (likely a custom wrapper or placeholder for C++ coroutines or futures) indicates an intent to mirror TypeScript's async patterns. The underlying C++ concurrency model and its consistent application require complete implementation and testing.
6.  **Completeness of Structural Mapping:**
    *   While major components are present, a detailed comparison would be needed to ensure all TypeScript SDK files, helper functions, internal types, and utility classes have corresponding (even if stubbed) counterparts in `DraftConversion` to ensure full structural parity. For example, specific transport handlers (StdIO, HTTP) and detailed authentication flow logic from the TS SDK need their C++ structural equivalents in `DraftConversion` clearly laid out.
7.  **Management of Callbacks and State:**
    *   `ServerMCP.hpp` shows a system for registering features (tools, resources, prompts) with callbacks, similar to the TypeScript SDK. The lifecycle management, state synchronization (e.g., for `listChanged` notifications), and thread safety of these registered components in a C++ context will require careful implementation.

Recommendations:

1.  **Prioritize Schema Integration:** Replace placeholder JSON manipulation in `DraftConversion` with the use of the strongly-typed C++ schemas defined in `Source/Public/Schemas/`. This will drive much of the implementation detail for request/response handling.
2.  **Refactor into Header/Implementation Files:** Restructure the code in `DraftConversion` to separate class/function declarations into header files (.hpp) and their definitions/implementations into corresponding source files (.cpp). This aligns with C++ best practices.
3.  **Address TODOs Systematically:** Work through the `// TODO:` comments in `Client.hpp`, `ServerMCP.hpp`, and other `DraftConversion` files to implement the missing C++ logic.
4.  **Solidify JSON Strategy (using nlohmann/json):** Leverage the provided `nlohmann/json` library for all JSON parsing, serialization, and manipulation. Implement robust serialization/deserialization routines mapping between the `Source/` C++ schemas and JSON, respecting MCP specifications. Decide on and implement a runtime JSON validation strategy if external data integrity is a concern.
5.  **Define Asynchronous Model:** Finalize and consistently apply a C++ asynchronous programming model (e.g., C++20 coroutines, futures/promises) for all I/O-bound operations and callback mechanisms.
6.  **Develop Transport Layers (using cpp-httplib for HTTP):** Implement the stdio and HTTP transport layers as per the MCP specification. Utilize the provided `cpp-httplib` library for the HTTP transport implementation. Ensure they integrate with the client/server core logic in `DraftConversion`.
7.  **Implement Authentication Flows:** Detail the C++ structures and logic for OAuth 2.1 based authorization for HTTP transports.

Conclusion for `DraftConversion`:

The `DraftConversion` provides a valuable starting skeleton by mirroring the structure and feature set of the TypeScript MCP SDK. Its "feature capture" compliance is significant. The immediate path forward involves integrating the more complete C++ schemas from the `Source/` directory and then systematically filling in the C++ implementation details where placeholders and TODOs currently exist. This will transform the structural translation into a functional C++ MCP SDK.
