# MCP SDK Transport Implementation Plan

## Current Status (80% Complete)

### Implemented Features
1. Core Transport Interface
   - Base Transport class with all required methods
   - JSON-RPC message format support
   - Event store interface defined (`EventStore.h`)
   - Basic `InMemoryEventStore` implemented for event storage and replay
   - Comprehensive callback system
   - SSE event support
   - Session ID management
   - Thread-safe implementations (as applicable per transport)
   - `AuthInfo` struct defined in `Transport.h` for managing authentication details

2. Transport Implementations
   - InMemoryTransport for in-process communication
   - StdioTransport for stdio-based communication
   - StreamableHTTPTransport for HTTP-based communication

3. Message Handling
   - Complete JSON-RPC message implementation
   - Support for all message types (Request, Response, Error, Notification)
   - Message validation utilities

### Immediate Implementation Tasks

1. Resumability Implementation
   - Complete EventStore implementation
     - Status: Partially Complete. `EventStore` interface defined. Basic `InMemoryEventStore` implemented, providing foundational event storage and replay.
   - Add resumption token handling
     - Status: Partially Implemented. Mechanisms for passing resumption tokens during send operations (`TransportSendOptions`) are in place. However, consuming tokens to `Resume` a session is **not yet implemented** (base `Transport::Resume` method is marked for future implementation).
   - Implement event replay mechanism
     - Status: Partially Complete. `InMemoryEventStore` includes a basic event replay mechanism (`ReplayEventsAfter`).
   - Add resumption support to all transports
     - Status: Not Implemented. Current transports (`InMemory`, `Stdio`, `StreamableHTTP`) do not support the `Resume` operation. Base `Transport::Resume` method is explicitly marked for future implementation.

2. Error Handling
   - Implement MCP error codes
     - Status: Partially Implemented. `MCP_Error` class and predefined error code constants are defined. Transports currently use string-based error reporting via `_onError`; transitioning to structured `MCP_Error` objects or defined constants for these callbacks is a potential enhancement.
   - Add comprehensive error propagation
     - Status: Implemented. Error propagation is handled via `ErrorCallback` in transports (currently with string messages).
   - Implement error recovery mechanisms
     - Status: Not Implemented. Likely dependent on full resumability implementation.
   - Add error validation and handling utilities
     - Status: Partially Implemented. `TransportUtilities` provide message validation (UTF-8, JSON-RPC). `MCP_Error` class supports JSON serialization for errors.

3. Connection Lifecycle
   - Implement proper initialization sequence
   - Add connection state management
   - Implement clean shutdown procedures
   - Add connection state validation

4. Message Validation
   - Add JSON-RPC message validation
   - Implement protocol version checking
   - Add capability negotiation
   - Add message format validation
